appengine-multi-delete
======================

Chrome plugin to display malloc lists for microcorruption Algiers and
Chernobyl levels.

Installation
------------

This is a chrome extension, so download this into a local directory, enable
developer mode in chrome, load this as an "unpacked extension", browse to
the versions page of your appengine application ...

Usage
-----

When working on the debugger page at https://microcorruption.com/cpu/debugger 
you should now see another box at the bottom right listing the first 10
list entries. This box should update whenever something changes on the page.
